## Making a network visualization (chord diagram) in Flourish
Network visualizations show connections and interrelationships between entities. A visually-interesting way to represent a small dataset containing this kind of information is with a chord diagram (larger or very complex datasets are better represented with a network diagram). We'll be using a free tool called [Flourish](https://app.flourish.studio/) to make an interactive visualization of this kind; in the walkthrough video below, I'll be using information about correspondence between some of the Founding Fathers sourced from [Founders Online](https://founders.archives.gov/), an initiative of the National Archives.

### Walkthrough video
Hosted on Temple's Panopto platform: https://temple.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=34f41c6f-3d77-4f02-baca-aeae017fa8d2&start=0. Let me know if you have trouble accessing it!

### Directions
1. Download the data
- The data at Founders Online has actually been added to since I made this video! So rather than making the whole dataset, you can actually just update it and plug it into Flourish. [Download the dataset](https://hist5152.github.io/fall22/FoundersOnlineNetworks.csv) and open it in a spreadsheet editor of your choice.
2. Following the directions in the video for creating the dataset, update the data. Save it as a CSV file!
3. Navigate to the Flourish [Chord Diagram template](https://app.flourish.studio/@flourish/chord-diagram/3) and explore the instructions.
4. Plug your data into the template and customize to your liking.
5. Publish and/or export the finished product as an HTML file, image file, or embeddable link in Flourish.
6. Drop the link to your completed visualization in this assignment here:
7. Commit the file and type DONE in the extended description box below.
