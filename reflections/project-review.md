    Amorphous, complex, and interdisciplinary, individuals interested in the field of Islamic art and architecture face frequent challenges when searching for digital resources that are both comprehensive and legible to an audience beyond a small community of specialists. Access to sources can often be granted only through a university library system or the online catalogues of various state archives that demand a special set of login credentials. When these barriers do not exist, institutions tend to relegate digital projects related to Islamic art and architecture to the corners of their websites in favor of ‚Äúless niche‚Äù topics featured on homepages. *Khamseen: Islamic Art History*, a collaborative endeavor produced by the University of Michigan, offers a digital resource with the authority and comprehensiveness necessary to the work of academics, as well as the legibility and navigability that appeals to wider publics. 

    *Khamseen* encompasses a diverse array of media that ranges from short-form presentations to a ‚Äúliving survey‚Äù that builds out from these presentations with additional visual and textual sources related to different periods in Islamic art history. The product of a grant bestowed by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the open-access platform aims to provide educators with a m√©lange of foundational studies from historians of Islamic art and original research created by innovative contemporary scholars. Analyses of topics such as pilgrimage (*hajj*) rites derived from Egyptian Muslim practices and eco-critical contemporary art from the Middle East presented in video form appear in a clear, efficient archive on the platform‚Äôs home page. Each 10‚Äì15-minute recording Includes closed-captions and, while the target audience may be educators, the brevity and accessibility of the content allows for engagement from any interested party that *Khamseen* further encourages by including a glossary of religious and art historical terms used across the platform.  

    What the project boasts in clarity of presentation it lacks in original design. Most written content appears in Times New Roman font, news updates on recent happenings in the field of Islamic art are infrequent and feature few visuals, and one must scroll to the bottom of the *Khamseen* homepage to discover the platforms social media channels. The absence of visually compelling design on the website works against its general appeal, making it appear dry and academic despite its dynamic content. Neither contributors nor editors provide a summary of the methodologies used in the production of individual presentations or *Khamseen* itself, thus leaving the platform open to critique by digital historians who consider this a critical part of producing history in the virtual world.  

    Despite its shortcomings, *Khamseen* provides essential resources for teaching and learning about Islam and its diverse visual cultures beyond the small global community of specialists. Wider audiences within academia would benefit from the cross-cultural and accessible approach taken by the contributors and editors to the platform. A dialogue between the *Khamseen* community and public historians‚Äîmore frequent users of digital technologies in their practices‚Äîwould also produce a mutually beneficial dialogue between the two parties. This discourse would allow public historians to expand their knowledge of Islam and realize the wealth of possibilities that exist when the religion and its art historical canon are integrated into global historical narratives, as well as allow for critiques of *Khamseen* that may lead its creators to integrate aspects such as data visualization or more innovative software into its resources.
